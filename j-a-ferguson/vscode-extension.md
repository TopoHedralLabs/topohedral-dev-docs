The purpose of this project is to provide some utilities for develping topohedral. Things like:

- Adding VIM-style folds easily 
- Removing VIM-style folds easily
- Copying/Cutting and pasting folds eaily 


Additionally we wish to have snippets for rust of the form:

```rust
//{{{ fun: name
/// TODO write docs
fn name()
{

}
//}}}

//{{{ struct: name
/// TODO write docs
struct name 
{

}
//}}}
```
